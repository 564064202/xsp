	* main.cs: added some documentation on RealMain.
	Added code to make sure single app mode is not used when running a
	non-stop server.
	In single app mode, when ThreadAbortException is thrown, make sure
	to shutdown up all the accepted sockets, or we'll end up with
	sockets with filled receive/send queues.
