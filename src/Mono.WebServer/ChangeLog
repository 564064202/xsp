	* XSPWorker.cs: close makes sure to unregister socket, so that
	there's no reference to it held by ApplicationServer.

	* ApplicationServer.cs: added a new public method,
	ShutdownSockets, to be called in single app mode to properly close
	all the listening and the accepted sockets.
	Added a pair of methods, {Register,Unregister}Socket to keep track
	of all the sockets to clean up in ShutdownSockets above.
	All sockets have SO_LINGER on.
