Directory xsp/src/HttpServer
-----------------------------

This directory contains a web server that serves .aspx pages.
It is intended for testing purposes only.

IMPORTANT: right now, it can only generate a given page once until we implement
something that unload assemblies loaded from .dll or move the dll to some other
place before loading them.

How does it work
------------------
Given a HTTP query in the form:

[GET|POST] filename.aspx HTTP/1.0

It generates its C# code using xsp, compiles it with mcs, renders the page
and send it back to the client.


How to test
------------

* Create a directory (./testing).

* Copy ../xsp.exe, ../MyForm.dll, server.exe and xsp.bat to it.

* Copy some aspx file to ./testing 

* (optional) Verify that xsp yourfile.aspx generates C# code and that mcs
can compile it).

* cd ./testing; ./server PORTNUMBER

* For real men:

	- telnet 127.0.0.1 PORTNUMBER
	  get yourfile.aspx http/1.0

* For the rest, use your browser: http://127.0.0.1:PORTNUMBER/yourfile.aspx

- Enjoy!
