	* Makefile: reference a local copy of mono System.Web.dll
	depending on DEBUGMONOSW environment variable to allow xsp.exe and
	server.exe use our System.Web.dll.

	* README: documented usage of DEBUGMONOSW.

	* server.cs: dll's are now in current directory.

	* server.cs: all the intermediate files now go to ./output directory.
	Also generates .BAT files containing the commands that the server
	tries to run. Hopefully, this helps a lot for debugging tasks.

	* README: added a couple of lines to document the above changes.
