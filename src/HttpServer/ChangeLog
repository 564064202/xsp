	* server.cs: fixed error when no ':' found.

2002-06-29  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* server.cs: preliminary page caching used for session tracking.

2002-06-04  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Makefile: delete local copy of System.Web.dll if DEBUGMONOSW is
	not set (just to avoid conflicts when running the server).
	
	* README: updated debug setup information to show how you can have two
	running servers on different ports one using mono and other MS.

	* server.cs: flush the output stream and close without throwing an
	exception under MS.

2002-06-03  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* server.cs: added --file command line option. If supplied, the next
	argument must be a .aspx file which will be rendered to HTML on
	console.

2002-06-03  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Makefile: reference a local copy of mono System.Web.dll
	depending on DEBUGMONOSW environment variable to allow xsp.exe and
	server.exe use our System.Web.dll.

	* README: documented usage of DEBUGMONOSW.

	* server.cs: dll's are now in current directory.

2002-06-03  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* server.cs: all the intermediate files now go to ./output directory.
	Also generates .BAT files containing the commands that the server
	tries to run. Hopefully, this helps a lot for debugging tasks.

	* README: added a couple of lines to document the above changes.

2002-06-03  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* README: documented how to help debugging System.Web.

	* server.cs: added option --usemonoclasses to test our System.Web
	and System.Drawing. Use csc instead of mcs to compile.

2002-05-31  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Makefile: New file.
	* README: New file.
	* server.cs: New file.
	* xsp.bat: New file.

	Highly experimental web server that uses xsp + mcs generate and compile
	pages from .aspx.
