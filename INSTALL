Testing XSP
============

Steps for installing the server:

	make 
	make install
	...and follow the instructions...

    You can change the listen port from the default (8080) using the
    configuration file (server.exe.config).

    Or you can use the --port command line option.

    If you're gonna try the samples that use a database (such as dbpage1.aspx),
    you may need to modify the values of DBProviderAssembly, DBConnectionType
    and/or DbConnectionString in web.config file.

NOTE for windows users: you may need to set authentication mode to "None" in
web.config file until RNGCryptoServiceProvider works in windows.
