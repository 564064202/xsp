Testing XSP
============

Steps for installing the server:

	make 
	make install
	...and follow the instructions...

    You can change the listen port from the default (8080) using the
    configuration file. Currently you have to change it in
    server/test/server.exe.config file, but we recommend keeeping that
    value synched with the one in server/test/web.config file because
    the first one will be deprecated in favor of the latter.

    Or you can use the --port command line option.
