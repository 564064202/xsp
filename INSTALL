* Compiling and installing XSP
-------------------------------

    We will assume you want to install XSP in /usr.

    To compile XSP type and install it to /usr:

	./configure --prefix=/usr
	make 
	make install

    If you don't specify --prefix, it will default to /usr/local.

    If ./configure finds 'gmcs' it will assume that you have an
    installation able to compile .NET 2.0 executables.  This means that
    you need to make sure you have the required assemblies installed.
    This is done from svn by:

    	./configure --profile=net_2_0
	make
	make install

    in the mcs/ svn module or configuring the mono tarball/module
    using the '--with-preview=yes' option.

* Running XSP with the bundled tests
------------------------------------

    Go to /usr/share/doc/xsp/test directory and run:

	mono /usr/bin/xsp.exe 

    You can optionally provide a port where the server should listen on:

	mono /usr/bin/xsp.exe --port 80

    The default port is 8080.

    There are other command line options. Run:
    
        mono /usr/bin/xsp.exe --help

    to display all of them.

Notes for MS runtime users
----------------------------
If you're compiling under windows, you may need to copy xsp.exe,
ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib.dll and Mono.Http.dll (distributed with mono) to
xsp/server and xsp/server/test/bin directories if it's not installed for
the system.

(*) In windows, if you want to build xsp using csc, do:

    MCS=csc make

You will also need IIS with support for ASP.NET for xsp to work with the
MS runtime.
