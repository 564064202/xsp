Testing XSP
============

Steps for installing the server:

	make 
	make install
	...and follow the instructions...

    You can change the listen port from the default (8080) using the
    configuration file (xsp.exe.config).

    Or you can use the --port command line option.

    If you're gonna try the samples that use a database (such as dbpage1.aspx),
    you may need to modify the values of DBProviderAssembly, DBConnectionType
    and/or DbConnectionString in web.config file.

Notes for MS runtime users
----------------------------
You may need to set authentication mode to "None" in web.config file until
RNGCryptoServiceProvider works in windows.
or
You can configure Mono.Security.Win32.dll as detailled in 
/mcs/class/Mono.Security.Win32/README to use an alternative (CryptoAPI) RNG.


If you're compiling under windows, you may need to copy 
ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib.dll and Mono.Http.dll (distributed with mono) to
xsp/server and xsp/server/test/bin directories if it's not installed for
the system.
