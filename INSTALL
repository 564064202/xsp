Testing XSP
============

You need to have mono and mcs installed.

Then run:

	make install

And it will create a directory called 'rundir' and copy the needed files.
Then:

	cd rundir
	mono server.exe PORTNUMBER

where PORTNUMBER is the port you want the server to listen on (ie, 8000).

Finally, just point your web browser to:

	http://127.0.0.1:PORTNUMBER/

and there you go!
