.SH NAME 
XSP \- Mono ASP.NET Web Server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mono xsp.exe
[options]
.PP
or
.PP
.B mono mod-mono-server.exe
[options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
XSP and mod-mono-server are both hosts for ASP.NET-based applications.
.PP
If run as `xsp', the process provides a minimalistic web server which
hosts the ASP.NET runtime and can be used to test and debug web
applications that use the System.Web facilities in Mono.  This server is
most convenient for testing and running small sites, does not offer
everything a production web server offers. 
.PP
`mod-mono-server' is an ASP.NET runtime host that can communicate with
another web server (at the time of this writing Apache 1.3 and Apache
2.0 were supported). This mechanism is better used for high-traffic
servers or production systems, since it can integrate with the main
HTTP server and leverage all of the optimizations and extensions of an
existing server, while providing the ASP.NET runtime.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I \-\-port PORT
Changes the default port where the XSP server will listen to
requests.  By default XSP listens on port 8080.
.TP
.I \-\-address addr
Sets the IP address to listen on. By default it's 0.0.0.0.
.TP
.I \-\-root PATH
The root directory for XSP.  The default is the directory where XSP is
executed. The current directory will be changed to this one before
creating any application.
.TP
.I \-\-appconfigfile FILENAME
Adds application definitions from the XML configuration file. See sample
configuration file that comes with the server (sample.webapp) and
.B WEBAPP FILE FORMAT
below.
.TP
.I \-\-appconfigdir DIR
Adds application definitions from all XML files found in the specified
directory DIR. Files must have '.webapp' extension.
.TP
.I \-\-applications APPS
A semicolon separated list of virtual directory and real directory for all the
applications we want to manage with this server. The virtual and real dirs. are
separated by a colon. The default value is '/:.'.
.TP
Some examples:
.TP
.B '/:.'
The virtual / is mapped to the current directory.
.TP
.B '/blog:../myblog'
The virtual /blog is mapped to ../myblog
.TP
.B '/:.,/blog:../myblog'
Two applications like the above ones are handled.
.TP
.I \-\-nonstop
This applies only to xsp.exe: by default xsp will stop processing
requests when the return key is pressed.  Use this to avoid this
behavior. 
.TP
.I \-\-version
Displays version information and exits.
.TP
.I --help
Shows the list of options and exits.
