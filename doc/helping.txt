How to help testing
---------------------
You can write ASP.NET pages using C# language and run xsp on them to see the
generated C# code.

This code must do the same as the MS generated code.

You have to install IIS and enable ASP.NET on it. When you install the .NET SDK
and have IIS installed, this is done automatically. If you already installed
the .NET SDK without having IIS, you should install IIS and reinstall the SDK.

In order to view the MS generated code, you can:

	* Add a 'debug="true"' attribute to the @ Page directive and look for
	the generated code under \WINNT\Microsoft.NET\Framework\.... (just
	look for *.cs files).

	* Make the compilation fail by introducing a mistake. For example, if
	you have a <script runat="server> change any keyword by something not
	a keyword or... Well, I'm sure you will find easy to make a
	compilation fail :). Then when you try to access that page, you will
	get an error page in which you have the generated code.

If xsp generates correct code for your page, feel free to upload it to the
xsp/test directoy.

Thanks!
