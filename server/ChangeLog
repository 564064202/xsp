	* MonoWorkerRequest.cs: use a default encoding without markers.
	* server.cs: Trace output goes to Console.Out.

2002-10-27  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Makefile: added Tracing.cs

	* MonoApplicationHost.cs: use WebTrace.
	
	* MonoWorkerRequest.cs: use WebTrace. Also changed FlushResponse. Now
	it outputs correctly the status and the headers.
	
	* Tracing.cs: new file. Almost the same as System.Web.Util.WebTrace.
	It's used to get some output under MS runtime, which disables normal
	tracing for System.Web.

	* server.cs: removed Trace stuff.

	* Makefile: added 'trace' target.
	* index.aspx: removed file added by mistake.

	* ChangeLog:
	* Makefile:
	* MonoApplicationHost.cs:
	* MonoWorkerRequest.cs:
	* global.asax:
	* index.aspx:
	* server.cs:
	* web.config: new web server that uses ASP.NET hosting capabilities.
	It works with MS runtime and will be used to debug our classes from
	now on. xsp/src/* is now obsoleted and will stop working some time soon.
