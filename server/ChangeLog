	* MonoWorkerRequest.cs:
	* XSPWorkerRequest.cs: moved GetUnknownHeader(s) here.

2003-01-14  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* IApplicationHost.cs: 
	* MonoWorkerRequest.cs: the same files as in mod_mono. They must be kept
	in synch.

	* XSPApplicationHost.cs: same as previous MonoApplicationHost, but
	implements IApplicationHost.

	* XSPWorkerRequest.cs: it derives now from MonoWorkerRequest. Removed
	some overrides that are already present in the base class.

	* server.cs: use XSPApplicationHost.

	* Makefile: added/removed files to SOURCES. Install the .dbg file.

	* MonoApplicationHost.cs: Removed file.

	Now mod_mono and xsp share IApplicationHost and MonoWorkerRequest.

	* MonoWorkerRequest.cs: it know handles directory requests either
	redirecting to a / terminated url for directories or searching for one
	of the default index files for / terminated urls.

	* server/Makefile: updated.
	* server/MonoWorkerRequest.cs: give credits to Opless (Simon White).
	* server/server.cs: get the port from a config file.
	* server/server.exe.config: configuration file.
	* server/web.config: added appSettings.

2002-10-31  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* MonoWorkerRequest.cs: use a default encoding without markers.
	* server.cs: Trace output goes to Console.Out.

2002-10-27  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Makefile: added Tracing.cs

	* MonoApplicationHost.cs: use WebTrace.
	
	* MonoWorkerRequest.cs: use WebTrace. Also changed FlushResponse. Now
	it outputs correctly the status and the headers.
	
	* Tracing.cs: new file. Almost the same as System.Web.Util.WebTrace.
	It's used to get some output under MS runtime, which disables normal
	tracing for System.Web.

	* server.cs: removed Trace stuff.

2002-10-23  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Makefile: added 'trace' target.
	* index.aspx: removed file added by mistake.

2002-10-22  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* ChangeLog:
	* Makefile:
	* MonoApplicationHost.cs:
	* MonoWorkerRequest.cs:
	* global.asax:
	* index.aspx:
	* server.cs:
	* web.config: new web server that uses ASP.NET hosting capabilities.
	It works with MS runtime and will be used to debug our classes from
	now on. xsp/src/* is now obsoleted and will stop working some time soon.
